Lab 1: Installing Python & Environment Setup
What I Learned

In this lab, I learned how to install Python 3 on different operating systems and verify the installation using the command line. I also explored setting up a proper Python development environment using popular IDEs and text editors such as Visual Studio Code and PyCharm. This lab established the foundation required for Python development.

🎯 Lab Objectives

Understand how to download and install Python 3

Verify Python installation using the command line

Set up a Python development environment

Configure an IDE or text editor for Python programming

🧪 Lab Tasks Performed

🔹 Task 1: Download and Install Python 3
Step 1.1: Download Python 3

Visited the official Python website

Navigated to the Downloads section

Downloaded the latest Python 3.x.x version for the operating system

Step 1.2: Install Python 3

Windows

Ran the downloaded installer

Checked “Add Python 3.x to PATH”

Clicked Install Now

macOS

Opened the downloaded .pkg file

Followed the on-screen installation instructions

Linux

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3


Key Concept:
Adding Python to PATH allows the system to recognize the python command globally.

🔹 Task 2: Verify Python Installation
Step 2.1: Check Python Version

Opened the terminal or command prompt and ran:

python --version


or

python3 --version


Observation:
The installed Python version was displayed correctly without any errors.

Key Concept:
Verifying the version ensures Python is installed correctly and accessible from the command line.

🔹 Task 3: Install an IDE or Text Editor
Step 3.1: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Downloaded VS Code from the official website

Installed it following OS-specific instructions

Installed the Python extension from Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X)

Configuration Check:

Verified Python interpreter path in VS Code

Ensured it matched the installed Python version

Step 3.2: PyCharm

Downloaded PyCharm Community Edition

Installed it using the platform-specific installer

Confirmed Python interpreter was detected correctly

Key Concept:
IDEs enhance productivity by providing syntax highlighting, debugging tools, and intelligent code completion.

Summary

In this lab, I successfully:

Installed Python 3 on my system

Verified the Python installation using the CLI

Set up a Python development environment

Configured popular IDEs/editors for Python development

This lab laid the groundwork for all future Python programming tasks and ensured a stable, efficient development setup.
