Lab 4: Arithmetic & Expressions
🧠 What I Learned

In this lab, I learned how to perform basic arithmetic operations in Python using expressions. I practiced addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and clearly understood the difference between integer division and floating-point division. This lab helped me strengthen my numerical and logical thinking in Python programming.

🎯 Lab Objectives

Understand and apply basic arithmetic operations in Python

Differentiate between integer division (//) and float division (/)

Write and execute Python scripts using arithmetic expressions

🧪 Lab Tasks Performed
🔹 Task 1: Writing a Script for Basic Arithmetic Operations

Objective:
Learn to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using Python.

Step 1: File Setup

Created a Python file named:

arithmetic_operations.py

Step 2: Taking User Input

Used the input() function and converted values to integers:

number1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
number2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

Step 3: Performing Arithmetic Operations

Addition

addition_result = number1 + number2
print(f"Addition: {number1} + {number2} = {addition_result}")


Subtraction

subtraction_result = number1 - number2
print(f"Subtraction: {number1} - {number2} = {subtraction_result}")


Multiplication

multiplication_result = number1 * number2
print(f"Multiplication: {number1} * {number2} = {multiplication_result}")


Division

division_result = number1 / number2
print(f"Division: {number1} / {number2} = {division_result}")

🔹 Task 2: Integer Division vs Float Division

Objective:
Understand how Python handles different types of division.

✅ Integer Division (//)

Returns the floor (whole number) result:

integer_division_result = number1 // number2
print(f"Integer Division: {number1} // {number2} = {integer_division_result}")

✅ Floating-point Division (/)

Returns the exact decimal value:

float_division_result = number1 / number2
print(f"Float Division: {number1} / {number2} = {float_division_result}")

🧩 Key Concepts

Addition (+): Combines two numbers

Subtraction (-): Finds the difference between numbers

Multiplication (*): Calculates the product

Division (/): Returns a decimal result

Integer Division (//): Returns a whole number without remainder

Summary

In this lab, I successfully:

Implemented basic arithmetic operations using Python

Learned how Python evaluates arithmetic expressions

Understood the difference between integer and floating-point division

Improved my problem-solving skills using numerical logic

This lab builds a strong foundation for advanced Python topics such as conditions, loops, and mathematical algorithms.
